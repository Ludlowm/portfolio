      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>My name is <strong>Marko Ludlow</strong>. I'm 22 years old, and will be 23 in April. I've moved around quite a bit when I was younger but it wasn't until recently that I decided to move to the west coast. Throughout growing up i've realized a passion for technology since I've had my first laptop. If there was something that could be tinkered I'd play around it (sometimes making it worse in the process). This is one of the many reasons why I decided to start coding, it couldn't make any more sense. </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I was born in the United Kingdom until I was one year old. I then spent some time in South Africa and Turkey until I moved to the U.S. when I was six years old. I finished up high school in New Hampshire and then 2 years ago <em>(2015)</em> decided to move to Portland, Oregon. Previously in New Hampshire I had worked as a bagger/cashier at a grocery store until I was able to secure a job at my local community college in IT doing helpdesk. Unfortunately I had to leave that job to come here, but I wouldn't be doing Epicodus if I hadn't moved here. </p>
